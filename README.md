In this project, I have developed a Sales Dashboard incorporating the following five key charts:

1. Total Sales: A comprehensive overview of the total sales figures.
2. Total Profit: An insight into the overall profit generated.
3. Total Quantity: The total quantity of products sold.
4. *Sales and Profit by Subcategory: A detailed breakdown of sales and profit by different product subcategories.
5. Rent Sales and Profit Trends Over Time : A timeline showing the trends in sales and profit specifically related to rent.

This dashboard aims to provide a clear and concise visual representation of essential sales metrics, facilitating better decision-making and performance analysis.
